# Introduction #

Zirco can be used almost as any other browser. Here is a few tips to use it better.

# The bubble #

The bubble is a small quarter-circle overlay at the bottom-right of the screen:

Touching it brings up the url bar and the tool bar:

The url bar can be used to navigate to home, type urls, stop page loading, etc.

The tool bar provide easy access to previous/next navigation buttons, open/close tabs and bookmarks.

Notes:
  * The bars hide automatically after a few time. This time can be changed through _Preferences_. If a page is loading, bars will hide after the page has loaded;
  * Touching the screen will hide the bars;
  * The _Bookmarks_ button in the tool bar can be changed to _History_ through _Preferences_;

# Switching tabs #

Switching between tabs is made by sweeping horizontally on the screen.

# Zooming #

Zooming in and out is made by the volume keys.
