There is currently several applications released on the Android market which are obviously derivating from Zirco, but do not comply with the [GPL V3 license](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html). These applications do not state under which license they are released, and do not provide access to their source code.

While i am glad that people find Zirco useful and base their work on it, i choose the GPL v3 on purpose, because i do not want any derivative to goes closed-source. The goal here is not to "kill" those applications, but to make them comply with the GPL v3.
